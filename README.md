# System-Health
 A script that checks the system's health.
 Developed a script that monitors the health of a Linux system. It checks the CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the script sends an alert to the console or updates a log file.
